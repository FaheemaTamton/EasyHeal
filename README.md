#  EasyHeal – Multimodal AI Prescription Understanding System

EasyHeal is an AI-powered healthcare web application designed to digitize and understand handwritten medical prescriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).

The system extracts medicine-related information directly from prescription images and converts them into structured, manageable healthcare data. It also generates medicine reminder alarms for patients based on dosage and intake schedules.

Built using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and locally hosted AI models through LM Studio.

#  AI Pipeline

Unlike traditional OCR-based systems, EasyHeal uses a multimodal Vision Language Model pipeline.

The uploaded prescription image is:
1. Preprocessed for clarity
2. Sent to a VLM through LM Studio
3. Parsed into structured JSON data
4. Stored into the healthcare management system

This allows the system to better understand:
- Handwritten prescriptions
- Medical abbreviations
- Dosage patterns
- Intake schedules
